 Follow the steps below to use it:
 1) The user is prompted to choose an LGSx file. If a file is already loaded in the project, it will be automatically selected.
 2) The points from the selected LGSx file are imported and converted into the project. The script supports importing up to a maximum of 100 million points.
 3) The user is asked to select a classification model from the available options. Once a model is chosen, the classification process begins.
 4) After classification, it is possible to filter points corresponding to certain classes
 5) Once the filter is applied, a new LGSx file is created by cloning the original file and replacing the existing points with the newly classified ones.
