- Check line objects exist and are named correctly
- Minimum 2 lines required for angle measurements

**"Script file not found"**
- Verify all script files in same directory
- Check file names match exactly
- Use main script to launch other modules

### Best Practices

1. **Consistent Naming**: Use sphere auto-rename feature for reliability
2. **Systematic Approach**: Start with main script for proper workflow
3. **Tolerance Setting**: Configure appropriate thresholds for application
4. **Result Validation**: Review SMeasure objects and reports
5. **Documentation**: Save measurement sessions for audit purposes
